# Advanced Regrression Assignment
> This Project was all about a US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data was provided to us in csv format. 
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. I have build a regression model using regularisation (Ridge and Lasso Regression)in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

 
## Table of Contents
* [General Info]: This Assignment has two parts, in first part We have done all the Data cleaning, Reduction, EDA, regression, to reach the conclusion. We have used the given dataset by Upgrad (train.csv) , and performed all the operations on the same. 
In the second part we have modified the data which we got in the first part and answered the subjective questions which was asked.
* [Technologies Used] : Used Python , Ridge regression , lasso regression , many different python functions like seaborn , matplotlib to reach to the conclusion.
* [Conclusions]: Concluded that Lasso Regression is best choice for this problem.
